- 👋 Hi, I’m @jdhaefer
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and the outdoors.  Being outside is what helps me break away sometimes from the grueling job of technology.  
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled at the Unviersity of Wisconsin-Platteville and obtaining my bachelors degree in Applied Computing. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!  I would love to learn more from others since my learning style is watching and doing hands on activities. 
- 📫 How to reach me, as the old saying goes, you can reach me through email! 
- ⚡ Fun fact: One fun fact that I have is that I have never flown before!
